# The Lure of the Gap Year

*Time of learning and maturing can mean refreshed batteries and prepared students.*

Tens of thousands of newly ***\*minted\**** high school graduates will troop to campuses across the country this fall to begin four or more years of collegiate life. But Liz Teixeria de Mattos won't be among them, even though she was accepted by ***\*prestigious\**** Vassar College in New York's Hudson Valley. Instead, she should be **wrapping up** a stay in Greece, where she had arranged to work with dolphins, and getting ready to head to South Africa. There, among other things, she'll **pitch in** at a **game preserve** and volunteer at an AIDS **orphanage**. Later she'll jet to London for a **stint** as a fashion industry **intern**. She's also scheduled time to travel around Europe.

But Teixeria de Mattos, 18, of Princeton, N.J. , is no **slacker**. She's a "gapper" --- one of a small but growing number of American students who are deciding to take a "gap year" off between high school and what would be their freshman year of college to travel, volunteer, work, study, and otherwise recharge their batteries before getting back on the **academic treadmill**. "I thought, 'Why not ? ' There are other ways of learning than sitting in a classroom, " says Teixeria de Mattos, who ultimately plans to earn a degree in environmental science.

That's a key point that many educators and other gap-year **proponents** make as well. They argue that the out-of-classroom experiences of a gap year give students eye-opening life lessons that help them become more mature, more aware of the wider world, and more self-sufficient, traits that will ultimately serve them well once they're on campus. "They develop nonacademic skills and end up better prepared, " says Holly Bull, who runs the New Jersey-based Center for Interim Programs, which helps students organize gap years. There's some **quantifiable** evidence **underscoring** that claim, too. A study of gap-year freshman at Skidmore College in New York found they had higher **grade point averages** than their peers.
